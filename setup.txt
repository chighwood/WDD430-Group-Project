Local repo setup by Sam Bonfanti

Week 3 Summary:
We talked about how the page should work and what the landing page will look like. We came up with
ideas and decided upon a couple things to add. We looked at a couple other websites to find looks
that we liked and things we wanted to add. One challange we came across was what data we were going
to need to add for our users and thier products. We will be looking more into what will need to be
needed. One success was getting it all set up and deciding what other TODO's we need to add to our
project board. We also started asigning ourselves to the task for the landing page.
